# Changelog

All notable changes to aarch.science. Dates are UTC. The catalog itself is
versioned per-image (date + content-hash tags); this records project-level milestones.

## 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Six verified, signed, public env images** on `quay.io/aarchsci`, each built
  native arm64 (no emulation), verified by an in-image D3 smoke test
  (assemble + import + functional), cosign keyless-signed in CI, and public:
  - `geospatial` (123 pkgs) — the founding fieldwork CPU-prep stack.
  - `earth-observation` (236 pkgs) — + xarray, dask, rioxarray, STAC clients.
  - `geo-ml` (378 pkgs) — + scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, geopandas, pysal.
  - `climate` (247 pkgs) — cartopy, cfgrib/eccodes, metpy, xesmf/esmpy regridding.
  - `pointcloud` (287 pkgs) — pdal, python-pdal, laspy, richdem.
  - `comp-chem` (195 pkgs) — rdkit, openmm, pyscf, xtb, ase, mdanalysis, mdtraj.
- **The env-model builder** (`builder/`): `build-env.sh` + a generic `Dockerfile`
  that installs a curated `envs/<name>.yaml`, reads the resolved set from the
  finished image, runs the D3 smoke test (refuses to tag on failure), writes a
  committed lock, and tags `<date>` + `s<lock-hash>` + `latest`.
- **`solve-hash.sh`** — cheap dry-run solve → lock-hash; the reconciler's
  "changed?" probe.
- **Self-running machinery**: daily `reconcile.yml` (re-solve each spec, rebuild on
  lock-hash drift), `publish.yml`, `sign-existing.yml`.
- **GAPS.md + `farm/skip-list.tsv`** — the honest arm64-gap record + wontfix/stuck
  skip tiers, wired into the reconciler.
- **Site** at [aarch.science](https://aarch.science/) (GitHub Pages, HTTPS),
  `robots.txt` + `llms.txt` agent-discovery, issue templates.

### Notable
- **D3 verification earned its keep** — it caught two assemble-not-solve failures a
  solve-only check would have shipped broken:
  - `climate`/`xesmf`: env solved but `import xesmf` failed (resolver picked
    xesmf 0.6.0, pre the ESMF 8.4 `ESMF`→`esmpy` module rename). Fixed with an
    `xesmf >=0.8.4` floor in the spec.
  - `pointcloud`/`whitebox`: solves + imports, but downloads a precompiled amd64
    binary from the network at runtime — wrong arch + runtime fetch. Recorded as
    the first `wontfix` and excluded; richdem covers terrain natively.
- **Finding:** across all six envs, **zero solve-gaps** — conda-forge science is
  near-total on arm64. The delivery channel (pip's fragile arm64 wheels) was the
  whole problem, exactly the project thesis.

### Settled
- OQ2 (versioning: date + `s<lock-hash>` + latest), OQ3 (registry `quay.io/aarchsci`,
  domain aarch.science), OQ4 (reconciler "changed" = lock-hash drift).
